[Attack Vectors]
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a large number of emails in quick succession to a target using the SecureMail web application using Burp (Intruder). As a result of the race condition, some of these messages may bypass encryption and arrive unencrypted at the recipient's end. Additionally, the attacker could exploit the issue by sending emails from a second account to the same recipient while the recipient is already being bombarded with messages. In both cases, unencrypted messages could be intercepted, exposing sensitive information that should have been protected.
